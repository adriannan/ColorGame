## How does it work?

[RGB color system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), reproduce a broad array of colors from the combination of the Red, Green and Blue lights. 
The red, green and blue channels have integer values from 0 to 255.


- on the page we've got six (or three in easy mode) random colors - always different
- one of those colors is listed up - the name of the color in RGB
- our job is to pick which one
